# CyberpunkSaveFileWatcher
checks your CyberPunk 2077 safe files for size to make sure they won't corrupt


There is currently a bug in Cyberpunk 2077 that corrupts your safe files when they exceed 8MB (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If6RgU14hb0).  
This program watches your safe files and shows you how much space they already have taken up.  
Current fix (22.12.2020): Sell to drop boxes and not to vendors, clean up your inventory(s) regulary. Basically: DON'T have to many items.

## HOW TO

Download the exe and run it. Thats all.
